# inkdrop-drawio

`**Broken! Not maintened at the moment.**`

**The plugin does not work with the latest version of Inkdrop. I am open for pull requests.**

It adds [draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) support to [inkdrop](https://inkdrop.app/).

The plugin is currently in Beta.

## Install

```
ipm install drawio
```

## Usage

Use the `Plugins` > `draw.io` menu to add a new diagram.

Existing diagrams can be opened and edited with the draw.io editor over the context menu.

## Open points

* Diagrams in multiple notes
* Deleting old diagrams
